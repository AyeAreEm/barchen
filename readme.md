# Bärchen
Bärchen is an AI powered English to German translator desktop app

# Which AI?
It uses Google-T5X which is the model before Google-T5X. It's main area of translation is the German.
It's also quite accurate but not overly big in terms of the model's file size which is fitting if anyone wants to clone this for themself.

# Raylib
Raylib is a graphics library made in C, usually for games. I realised that there isn't a lot of differences between making a game and a desktop app so
I decided to try. I am already quite familiar with Raylib and C but only for game development.
